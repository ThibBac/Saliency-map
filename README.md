## Overview
This project follows the implementation of Itti's and Koch's model of Saliency map inspired by the behavior and the neural architecture of the early primate visual system.

## Installation Dependencies:
* Python 2.7 or 3
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scipy
* OpenCV

## What is a Saliency map ?

In computer vision, a saliency map is an image that shows each pixel's unique quality. The goal of a saliency map is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. For example, if a pixel has a high grey level or other unique color quality in a color image, that pixel's quality will show in the saliency map and in an obvious way. Saliency is a kind of image segmentation.

## Saliency Algorithm

## Experiments

#### Architecture


#### Specifications of my code



#### Experimental results

The metric used to judge the model efficiency is the AUC score.

Those curves were generated by training 5 differents model and ensembling them.

This first result is obtained with the standard implementation of the CHOWDER algorithm.
We can see that it is slightly overfitting.

This second result is obtained with my custom CHOWDER algorithm, with 2 diffents classifier.
Those results are very similar to the original implementation.

#### Limitations and potential improvements
  
1. The dataset is small so the network can have difficulties to converge and generalize well.
With acces to the initial image, we can generate more tiles using ImageDataGenerator, indeed a tiles that is flipped or rotated is still cancerous or healthy.

2. Greats improvemnents can be done by a better tuning of the hyper-parameter, i talk about it in the next section.




## FAQ

#### How to reproduce?

Dowload the Saliency_map.ipynb.

Then change thoses lines according to what you want :
 
```python
train_dir = "data/train_input/resnet_features"
test_dir = "data/test_input/resnet_features"

train_output_filename = "data/train_output.csv"
test_output_filename = "data/test_output.csv"

NB_RUNS = 5               # Number of models to train
model_choice = 'CHOWDER'  # Chose your model : CHOWDER or CHOWDER_test
REG = 0.6                 # Regularization strenght
NB_FOLDS = 3              # Number of crossvalidation's folds
```
